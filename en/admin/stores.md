In CoopCycle's « vocabulary », a **Store** represents a B2B customer, i.e. a professional merchant to whom the cooperative offers its delivery services.

Basically, a **Store** is a container for deliveries.
Users can be attached to a **Store**, and once attached, they can use the web interface to order deliveries using a form.
The deliveries ordered this way land directly in the dispatch.

## Store Settings

The settings will change the behavior of the form to order a delivery.
